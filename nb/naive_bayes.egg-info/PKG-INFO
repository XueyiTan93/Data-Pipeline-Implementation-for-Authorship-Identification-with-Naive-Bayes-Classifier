# What this code does

# How to use

# Reference
For the training and testing method code, I referenced Professor Trevor Adriaanse's code in my own work.
Things my code for assignment 2 should modify: 
1.In my testing method, I didn't specify "if token in vocabulary:", which skipped words that do not appear in the training vocabulary, resulting in wrong classfication.
2.Comparing to mine, professor made "vocabulary" of training data a dictionary not a list, which is more intuitive and convenient.
Things Professor's code should have done better:
1.In function train_nb(), it seems more straighforward to use enumerate, but every time running it may result a different order of word in vocabulary, which cause trouble to pytest. Therefore, I modified this part using a for loop beginning from the first row in df['text'] and now the order of word in vocabulary is stable.

My code for creating vocabulary:
vocabulary={}
    index_t=0
    for i in df['text']:
        tokens=i.split()
        for token in tokens:#iterate through the tokens, ignore the token has already in the voc and add new token
            if token not in vocabulary:
                vocabulary[token]=index_t
                index_t=index_t+1
